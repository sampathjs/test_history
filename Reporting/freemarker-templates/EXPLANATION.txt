This directory contains templates for emails to be used by the Limits Reporting module. They are for an OpenSource module called Freemarker from Apache.
The files and the containing directory should not be deleted unless the module is retired.

The location of this directory can be defined in the ConstantsRepository using 
  * LimitsReporting\EOD\freemarkerTemplateDirectory
  * LimitsReporting\IntradaySummary\freemarkerTemplateDirectory
  * LimitsReporting\Intraday\freemarkerTemplateDirectory

It is recommended to just set the "freemarkerTemplateDirectory" variable with an empty context und subcontext and store all Freemarker templates in this directory.

These are maintaind in GIT's repository endur\Reporting\freemarker-templates
