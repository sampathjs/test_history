Ideally this folder should be managed by proper dependency management, e.g. entries declared by Maven POM and binaries retrieved from internal Artifactory.

Unfortunately historically this is not the case and the Artifactory is not configured for Endur yet. Therefore the binaries are saved in BitBucket just for now.

However, the proper dependency management will be set up soon as well as updating this folder.
